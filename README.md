# CoilWinder

## Version : 1

### Abstract :

An evolutive coil winder machine based on *Arduino*.
The format of this machine can easily be adapted and upgraded for any coils.

---

### State of development :

  * Hardware -> functional
  * Software -> v1.0 : ok for coils production. Homing not working properly.

Software is write with the help of *platformIO* and *Eclipse*.
